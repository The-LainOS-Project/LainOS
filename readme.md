# Â¡Welcome to LainOS Project!
### Official LainOS Project Website : https://lainos.dev
## LainOS is a community driven Linux project built by some developers from the Serial experiments Lain community who came together and decided it was time to do something about the execution of the LainOS concept and now project.
This project aims to create a light, useful and powerful linux distribution based on Arch Linux aimed at developers, tinkerers, and hackers alike who share admiration for Serial Experiments Lain and similar works.
